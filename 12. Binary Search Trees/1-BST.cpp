/* Binary Search Tree (BST) is a tree inspired from Binary search algorithm.
 For every Node 'n' of BST, every node on n's LEFT sub-tree is less then n's data and
 every node on n's RIGHT sub-tree is greater than n's data. 
 
 A Balanced tree is a tree in which the |height of left sub-tree - height of right sub-tree|
 is at most 1.

/*
Types of Balanced BST :
1. AVL Trees 
2. Red Black Trees
3. 2-4 Trees
